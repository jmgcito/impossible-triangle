# Impossible Triangle

A little project made using P5.js, HTML, and CSS.

## Things I Learned
- Integrating my creations on p5.js into CSS and HTML
- Lighting, positioning, rotating, shaping 3D objects
- Mouse interactivity (click and position)
- Firefox Developer Tools exist and are useful

## Conclusion
This was a fun side project that shows off what messing around in P5 can look like :)
